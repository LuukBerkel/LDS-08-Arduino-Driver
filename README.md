# ld08-Lidar-Arduino-Driver
This is a port of the ld08-driver from robotis (Sometimes referred to as LDS_02 by robotis with their turtlebots) for use with the arduino framework. For more information about this lidar go to the site: https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/appendix_lds_02/

This driver is capable and tested to run on any microcontroller that has a second serial port available. It uses Serial2 for this functionality.
